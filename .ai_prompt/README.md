# AI Assistant Instructions for Forge Publisher

This folder contains instructions for AI assistants (GitHub Copilot, Claude, etc.) to help them understand and work effectively with the Forge Publisher codebase following Buildly Forge standards.

## Instruction Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| [overview.md](./overview.md) | Project overview and architecture |
| [coding-standards.md](./coding-standards.md) | Code style and conventions |
| [testing-guidelines.md](./testing-guidelines.md) | Testing requirements and patterns |
| [data-management.md](./data-management.md) | Database and data handling rules |
| [documentation-standards.md](./documentation-standards.md) | Documentation requirements |
| [security.md](./security.md) | Security considerations |

## Quick Context for AI

**Project:** Forge Publisher — AI-powered manuscript-to-EPUB publishing pipeline  
**Stack:** Django 6.0, SQLite, Python pipeline scripts, Tailwind CSS  
**Python:** 3.11+  
**AI Providers:** Ollama (preferred), OpenAI (fallback)  
**Output:** EPUB ebooks with interactive annotations, audiobooks with TTS  

### Key Patterns

1. **Pipeline + UI**: Pipeline scripts run on-demand (not a server), Django UI manages everything
2. **AI Config from DB**: `config.py` loads AI providers from Django DB, falls back to `.env`
3. **Branding in one place**: `branding.py` centralizes publisher name, persona, edition metadata
4. **Environment-based config**: Secrets and deployment settings via environment variables

### Important Directories

- `pipeline/scripts/` — Pipeline processing modules
- `pipeline/manuscripts/` — Input manuscripts (plain text)
- `pipeline/output/` — Generated EPUBs, audiobooks, logs
- `ui/books/` — Django app (models, views, templates)
- `ui/publisher_django/` — Django project settings
- `ops/` — Startup and operations scripts
- `devdocs/` — Developer documentation

# AI Assistant Instructions for Forge Communicator

This folder contains instructions for AI assistants (GitHub Copilot, Claude, etc.) to help them understand and work effectively with the Forge Communicator codebase following Buildly Forge standards.

## Instruction Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| [overview.md](./overview.md) | Project overview and architecture |
| [coding-standards.md](./coding-standards.md) | Code style and conventions |
| [testing-guidelines.md](./testing-guidelines.md) | Testing requirements and patterns |

| [security.md](./security.md) | Security considerations |

## Quick Context for AI

**Project:** Forge Communicator - Real-time team communication platform  
**Stack:** FastAPI, PostgreSQL (async), HTMX, Jinja2, WebSockets  
**Python:** 3.11+  
**Formatter:** Ruff (line length 100)  
**Tests:** pytest with async support  

### Key Patterns

1. **Async-first**: All database operations use SQLAlchemy async
2. **Dependency injection**: Use FastAPI `Depends()` pattern
3. **Service layer**: Business logic in `app/services/`
4. **Multi-tenant**: Data isolated by Workspace

### Important Directories

- `app/models/` - SQLAlchemy ORM models
- `app/routers/` - FastAPI route handlers
- `app/services/` - Business logic services
- `app/templates/` - Jinja2 templates
- `tests/` - Test suite
- `alembic/versions/` - Database migrations
